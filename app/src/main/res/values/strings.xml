        Dear <b>Doxy VPN Users</b>,<br><br>

        We would like to inform you about the latest update to the Doxy VPN application, released on 27.11.2023. With this recent update, our primary focus has been on enhancing the performance and user experience of our application.<br><br>

        Throughout the update process, no issues were identified during the testing stages. However, due to the diverse nature of the Android ecosystem, we have addressed and resolved some issues that were reported by our users. Thanks to the updates implemented thus far, <b>91.65%</b> of our users are currently enjoying a flawless and seamless experience with our application.<br><br>

        Our goal is to achieve a <b>100%</b> satisfaction rate with the upcoming updates. We highly value the feedback from our esteemed users and continuously strive to improve our application based on your input.<br><br>

        <b>New Features in the upcoming Version 2.0:</b><br><br>

        - We have added a virtual currency called <b>Dox Coin</b> to the application.<br><br>
        - The virtual currency will be mined when activated within the application.<br><br>
        - Your mining speed will increase when connected to the VPN.<br><br>
        - You will earn coins every day you log in to the application.<br><br>
        - After a certain period, when the required quantities are reached, the coins will convert to real virtual currency equivalent to real money.<br><br>
        - You can use this virtual currency to access premium servers.<br><br>

        <i>This update has been designed to make the Doxy VPN application more user-friendly and reliable. Thanks to the valuable feedback from our users, we are continuously working to enhance and improve our application.</i><br><br>
